# üåà RGB Light Control - Color Cycling

## üìù Overview
This Arduino project controls an RGB LED and cycles it through different colors ‚Äî Red, Green, Blue, and White. It demonstrates how to control multiple pins with PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) to create color effects.

## üß∞ Components Used
- **Arduino UNO**
- **Common Cathode RGB LED**
- **Breadboard**
- **Jumper Wires**

### ‚öôÔ∏è Wiring:
- Connect the **common cathode** (longest pin) of the RGB LED to **GND** on the Arduino.
- Connect:
  - **Red pin** of the RGB LED to **PWM pin 9** through a **220Œ© resistor**.
  - **Green pin** of the RGB LED to **PWM pin 10** through a **220Œ© resistor**.
  - **Blue pin** of the RGB LED to **PWM pin 11** through a **220Œ© resistor**.

*(Resistors help limit the current and protect the LED.)*

## üßë‚Äçüîß How It Works
- The RGB LED has three color pins (Red, Green, Blue) connected to PWM pins 9, 10, and 11 of Arduino UNO.
- The Arduino sets different analog (PWM) values on each pin to control the brightness of each color.
- By turning on Red, Green, and Blue individually and together, the LED displays Red, Green, Blue, and White colors in sequence.
- After each color, the LED stays on for 1 second, then switches to the next color.
